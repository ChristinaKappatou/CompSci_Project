# CompSci Project 1: Machine Learning

Inspired by the work of Stone, 1978 ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377026578900064]), I performed a polynomial fit analysis on the non-dimensional meridional heat transport equation, using a series of machine learning techniques. After applying plain Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Ridge regression, as well as their Bootstrap and Cross-Validation resampling variations, I concluded that the polynomial degree should be at least 6, in order to achieve a satisfactory bias-variance trade-off. Moving into choosing the optimal polynomial coefficients, I used plain Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), both with and without momentum, on OLS and Ridge regression. The learning rate was tuned by varying its constant values and exponentially but I also tested the effects of Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square propagation (RMS-prop) and ADAptive Moment estimation (ADAM) tuning techniques. Using the simplest variation, GD for OLS with a constant learning rate, resulted in a polynomial exceptionally close to the one acquired from the theoretical solution, that is the inversion of the Hessian matrix, for a version of Stone's equation that includes random noise.
